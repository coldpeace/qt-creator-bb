    \title Deploying Applications to Android Devices

    To specify settings for deploying applications to Android devices, select
    \gui Projects > \gui Run.

    \image qtcreator-deploy-android.png "Deploy configurations"

    Select the \gui {Use device's Qt libs} option to use Qt libraries installed
    on the device. If you do not select the \gui {Use local Qt libs} option,
    the application needs the Ministro package to run. However, if you select
    the \gui {Use local Qt libs} option, \QC passes special parameters to the
    application, forcing it to use Qt libraries from the \c{/data/local/qt}
    folder on the device

    Select the \gui {Deploy local Qt libs} option to deploy Qt libraries from
    the specified Qt for Android SDK (for exmple, android-lighthouse-4.8.0).
    This option enables you to develop on the Qt framework to test it.

    The \gui {Deploy local Qt libs} option automatically selects the
    \gui {Use local Qt libs} option. It is deselected automatically after \QC
    pushes the Qt libs to the device. Select the option again to push your local
    Qt modifications to devices. This option takes the same effect as the
    \c{push_qt_libs.sh} script thas is located in the root folder of the
    Qt for Android SDK. You can also use the \gui {Use local Qt libs}
    independently of the \gui {Deploy local Qt libs} option.

    \section1 Installing Ministro

    To install Ministro, select the \gui {Install Ministro system} option. You
    can also use it to install any Android package (.apk). You can use this
    option to install applications on an Android Virtual Device (AVD). Download
    the Ministro .apk from the Google Market or from the
    \l{http://necessitas.kde.org/necessitas/ministro.php}{Ministro} home page.
