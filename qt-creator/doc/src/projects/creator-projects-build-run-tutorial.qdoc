    \title Building and Running an Example

    You can test that your \QSDK installation is successful by opening an existing
    example application project.

    \list 1

        \o  On the \gui Welcome page, select \gui Examples (1).

            \image qtcreator-gs-build-example-open.png "Selecting an example"

        \o  Search for \gui {Toys: Clocks Example} (2) in the list of examples
            and select it (3).

            \note The project opens in the \gui Edit mode, and the documentation
            for the example hides these instructions. To return to these
            instructions, select \gui {Previous Page} on the toolbar or
            press \key {Alt+Left}.

        \o  Select \gui Projects to configure the project:

            \list 1

                \o  Select the kits \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} (1) that
                    specify the devices you develop for.

                \o  Select \gui {Configure Project} (2).

            \endlist

        \o  To check that the application code can be compiled and linked for a
            device, click the \gui {Kit Selector} and select a kit for the
            device.

            \image qtcreator-kit-selector.png "Selecting a kit to build with"

        \o  Click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-run.png
            (\gui Run) to build and run the application.

        \o  To see the compilation progress, press \key{Alt+4} to open the
            \gui {Compile Output} pane.

            The \gui Build progress bar on the toolbar turns green when the
            project is successfully built. The application opens on the device.

    \endlist
