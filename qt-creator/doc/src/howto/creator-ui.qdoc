    \endlist

    \image qtcreator-breakdown.png

    You can use the mode selector (1) to change to another \QC mode.

    You can use the kit selector (2) to select the
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} for running (3), debugging (4), or
    building (5) the application. Output from these actions is displayed in the
    output panes (7).

    You can use the locator (6) to to browse through projects, files, classes,
    methods, documentation, and file systems.

    \section1 Modes

    The mode selector allows you to quickly switch between tasks such as editing
    project and source files, designing application UIs, configuring how
    projects are built and executed, and debugging your applications. To change
    modes, click the icons, or use the \l{keyboard-shortcuts}
    {corresponding keyboard shortcut}.

    The following image displays an example application in \gui Edit mode (1)
    and \gui Design mode (2).

    You can use \QC in the following modes:

    \list

        \o  \gui Welcome mode for opening projects.

        \o  \gui{\l{Coding}{Edit}} mode for editing project and source
            files.

        \o  \gui{\l{Designing User Interfaces}{Design}} mode for designing and
            developing application user interfaces. This mode is available for
            UI files.

        \o  \gui{\l{Debugging}{Debug}} mode for inspecting the state of your
            application while debugging.

        \o  \gui{\l{Specifying Build Settings}{Projects}} mode for configuring
            project building and execution. This mode is available when a
            project is open.

        \o  \gui{\l{Analyzing Code}{Analyze}} mode for using code analysis tools
            to detect memory leaks and profile C++ or QML code.

        \o  \gui{\l{Getting Help}{Help}} mode for viewing Qt documentation.

    \endlist

    Certain actions in \QC trigger a mode change. Clicking on \gui {Debug} >
    \gui {Start Debugging} > \gui {Start Debugging} automatically switches to
    \gui {Debug} mode.

    \section1 Browsing Project Contents

    The sidebar is available in the \gui Edit and \gui Debug modes. Use the
    sidebar to browse projects, files, and bookmarks, and to view the class
    hierarchy.

    \image qtcreator-sidebar.png

    You can select the content of the sidebar in the sidebar menu (1):

    \list

        \o  \gui Projects shows a list of projects open in the current
            session.

        \o  \gui{Open Documents} shows currently open files.

        \o  \gui Bookmarks shows all bookmarks for the current session.

        \o  \gui{File System} shows all files in the currently selected
             directory.

        \o  \gui {Class View} shows the class hierarchy of the currently
            open projects.

        \o  \gui Outline shows the symbol hierachy of a C++ file and the element
            hierarchy of a QML file.

        \o  \gui {Type Hierarchy} shows the base classes of a class.

    \endlist

    You can change the view of the sidebar in the following ways:

    \list

        \o  To open files that belong to a project, double-click them in the
            project tree. Files open in the appropriate editor, according to the
            file type. For example, code source files open in the code editor
            and image files in the \l{Viewing Images}{image viewer}.

        \o  To bring up a context menu containing the actions most commonly
            needed right-click an item in the project tree. For example, through
            the menu of the project root directory you can, among other actions,
            build, re-build, clean and run the project.

        \o  To hide the categories and sort project files alphabetically, click
            \inlineimage qtcreator-filter.png
