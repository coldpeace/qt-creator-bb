    \title Deploying to Mobile Devices

    Deploy configurations in the \gui Project mode \gui {Run Settings} handle
    the packaging of the application as an executable and copying it to a
    location you want to run the executable at. The files can be copied to a
    location in the file system of the development PC or a mobile device.

        \o  \l{Deploying Applications to Android Devices}

            When you deploy the application on an Android device, \QC copies
            the application files to the device. In addition, you can determine
            the Qt libraries to use.
        \o  \l{Deploying Applications to Linux-Based Devices}

            When you deploy the application on a Linux-based device, such
            as embedded Linux, MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan, or Maemo 5/Fremantle, \QC
            copies the application files to the connected device. You
            can test and debug the application on the device.
            You can create Debian installation packages for MeeGo Harmattan and
            Maemo 5/Fremantle devices.
        \o \l{Deploying Applications to QNX Devices}

            When you deploy the application on a BlackBerry, \QC  generates a
            BAR package in the build directory and deploys it to the connected
            device. When you deploy it on a QNX Neutrino device, \QC copies
            the application files to the connected device. You can test and
            debug the application on the device.

        \o  \l{Publishing}

            When you are ready to publish the application on a publishing
            channel, you must make sure that the installation file meets the
            requirements for publishing on the channel.
